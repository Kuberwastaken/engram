## Project Overview

**ENGRAM** is a modern, open-source web platform designed to centralize all study materials for IP University students across 8 engineering branches and semesters. 

ENGRAM is and will **always stay free to access with no ads and no trackers**. It aims to provide instant access to notes, previous year questions, lab manuals, and comprehensive resources without the typical friction of academic resource hunting or unreliable websites.

**Born from Frustration, Built for (potential) Solutions**

> *"I don't know about you, but during exam prep, I don't like having to open 4 different websites, 2 drive links and 4 WhatsApp groups just to get good material. Sometimes the websites are down, have bad UI and are filled with ads, half the notes are outdated or just confusing. This was me literally two days before our last exam and I honestly had it. That's why I started making ENGRAM."*

### **What We Have Now** 
- ✅ **Aggregated Content** - Notes from Dotnotes, SyllabusX, and Fifteenfourteen (with proper credits)
- ✅ **Clean Interface** - Modern, space-themed UI with no ads or trackers
- ✅ **Smart Organization** - Branch and semester-based structure
- ✅ **Google Drive Integration** - Currently using JSON metadata with Google Drive links for 10,000+ materials

### **What's Coming Next**
- 🚧 **Dedicated Materials Repository** - Moving away from Google Drive to a proper GitHub-based system
- 🚧 **Community Upload System** - Easy pull request workflow for material contributions
- 🚧 **Real-time Updates** - Always current materials with community maintenance
- 🚧 **Contributor Recognition** - Your name on every note you upload

> **Note:** We're currently using JSONs with Google Drive links, but we're working toward a dedicated repository for notes. It's challenging to manage 10,000+ notes and we're still not complete, but we're committed to making it happen! The transition will

<br><strong>Network Effects</strong><br>
<em>The more students contribute, the better ENGRAM becomes for everyone. We need critical mass to become the go-to resource.</em>
</td>

### **The Vision: A Legacy That Outlives Us**

- 🎯 **The First Stop** - Every IPU student's go-to resource for any subject
- 🏆 **Quality Guaranteed** - Peer-reviewed content that students actually trust
- 🚀 **Always Current** - Real-time updates as syllabi change and new materials emerge
- 🤝 **Student-Led** - Decisions made by and for the community
- 🌟 **Recognition System** - Contributors get credited for every upload
- 🔄 **Self-Sustaining** - A resource that evolves and improves with each batch of students

> *"I want us to create a resource that out-lives us even after graduation, constantly evolves and is a token from us to our future juniors."*

- **Stellar Performance** - Smooth 60fps animations throughout
- **Universal Accessibility** - Clear contrast and readable typography

## 📚 How to Contribute Materials (Current Process)

> **Note:** This is our current system using Google Drive links. We're working on a much better GitHub-based system!

### Current Workflow
1. **Organize Your Materials** - Sort by branch, semester, and subject
2. **Upload to Google Drive** - Ensure public sharing is enabled
3. **Update JSON Metadata** - Add entries to appropriate data files
4. **Submit Pull Request** - Include proper attribution and descriptions
5. **Community Review** - Materials get reviewed for quality and accuracy

### Naming Conventions
- **Files:** `Subject_Topic_Version.pdf` (e.g., `DSA_LinkedLists_v2.pdf`)
- **PYQs:** Include year and exam type (e.g., `PYQ_2023_EndSem.pdf`)
- **Labs:** Include experiment number (e.g., `Lab05_BinaryTrees.pdf`)

### Future Contribution System
- **📁 Direct GitHub Upload** - No more Google Drive dependency
